/**
 * <p>
 * This trait deals with the captured lineage information.
 * When the lineage data is ready the instance of this trait is called to publish the result.
 * Which implementation is used depends on the configuration.
 * <br>
 * See [[ConfProperty.RootLineageDispatcher]]
 * </p>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * A custom lineage dispatcher can be registered via the configuration properties.
 * First you define name and then class for that dispatcher same way as it's done in spline.default.yaml
 * for the default http dispatcher.
 *
 * <br>
 * See: [[za.co.absa.spline.harvester.conf.StandardSplineConfigurationStack]]
 * </p>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * When registering a class by config properties, the constructor can have access to the configuration object via constructor injection:
 * {{{
 *    @throws[SplineInitializationException]
 *    def constr(conf: org.apache.commons.configuration.Configuration)
 * }}}
 * </p>
