Spline Gateway Server Mock
===

Simple server mocking producer API. It allows you to test the agent without any existing Spline server.

The mock will throw away any request, but it returns a valid response to the agent.

### Instalation
```
npm install -g mockserver
```

### Usage
```
./start.sh
```
This will start the server on `localhost:8080`
